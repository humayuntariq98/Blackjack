# Blackjack
A front end browser based game to challenge me and enhance my skills with HTML CSS and JavaScript. The game is based on chance but has some strategy involved as well. The rule are as follows : <br>
- Blackjack hands are scored by their point total.<br>
 - The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21. <br>
- A hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. 
- Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10. 
- An ace's value is 11 unless this would cause the player to bust, in which case it is worth 1.
